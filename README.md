# LangChain‑DataAgents

A Jupyter Notebook demonstrating how to build and execute **data‑driven agents** using [LangChain](https://python.langchain.com/), enabling automated workflows for data ingestion, analysis, and tool‑based reasoning.

---

## 🔍 Overview

This notebook (`LangChain_DataAgents.ipynb`) showcases:

- How to construct **LangChain agents** that orchestrate data retrieval, transformation, and analysis.
- Integrating multiple tools—like SQL engines, document loaders, and custom APIs—into an **autonomous agent pipeline**.
- Use cases such as: data extraction, executing queries, summarizing results, generating visualizations, and responding to natural language requests.

---

## 🚀 Key Use Cases

- Generating **SQL or Python code** automatically via LLMs.
- Executing code dynamically and feeding results back to the agent.
- Incorporating tools like GitHub loaders, data stores, or external APIs.
- End-to-end workflows chaining **tool calls + LLM reasoning**.

---

## 🛠 Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+  
- Jupyter Notebook installed (or JupyterLab / VS Code interactive)  
- LangChain (Python) library  
- OpenAI API key (or other supported LLM provider)  
- Additional dependencies based on tools used (e.g. `langchain-community`, `unstructured`, database libraries)

---

## 📥 Installation & Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/petersonchiquetto/LangChain‑DataAgents.git
cd LangChain‑DataAgents
pip install -r requirements.txt
````

Create a `.env` (or export env vars):

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_key"
# export GITHUB_TOKEN="your_github_token"  # if needed for GitHub loaders
```

---

## ⚙️ Usage

1. Launch the notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook LangChain_DataAgents.ipynb
   ```
2. Run each cell sequentially or use “Restart & Run All”.
3. Follow along as the agent:

   * Loads data sources (e.g. GitHub files, CSV, APIs),
   * Generates and executes code (SQL or Python),
   * Summarizes outputs and wraps up with final responses.

Explore modifications like changing data sources, tweaking prompts, or adding new tools.

## 🧠 How It Works

| Component            | Description                                                                                        |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Prompt Design**    | Templates that guide the agent’s behavior and thinking.                                            |
| **Tool Integration** | Tools such as GitHub loaders, Python REPL, SQL engines.                                            |
| **Agent Logic**      | Agent executes tools based on language-model decisions, and interprets results.                    |
| **Execution Loop**   | The LLM selects tools → tool runs → tool response returned to agent → agent continues or finishes. |

## 🎯 What You’ll Learn

* Building **multi-step agents** in a notebook environment.
* Combining **LLM reasoning** with deterministic tool execution.
* Automating **data workflows**: ingestion → execution → summarization.
* Extending agents with new tools or connectors.

---

## 📦 Extending & Customizing

Suggested extensions:

* Compose a **multi-agent system** (e.g. a manager agent and specialized sub-agents).
* Add new tools like web search APIs, vector stores, or dashboards.
* Replace the LLM provider or experiment with local LLMs.
* Persist agent memory using LangSmith or external stores.
